let's say we want to synth the following program:
rs = min(2x , x-2)

given these two example:
3_1 : 0 => -2
3_2 : -3 => -6

we get:
if x > -1:   <---------- this condion is not right!
	rs = x - 2
else:
	rs = x + x
  
***not exactly  what we wanted but if the condition was right we would be happy.
  
if we will add more the following counterexample:
3_3 = -1 => -3

we get:

if -1 > x:
	rs = x + x
else:
	rs = x - 2
  
  still not what we wanted but no more counterexamples can be given since the synthesizer does nor support non integers.
  
  if we could say to the synthesizer not spliting the examples. we would get the desired code!!!
